        <ul>
            <li><p>Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people.It is generally used as a decision-making tool or for fun, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V).</p></li>
            <li><p>This game originated in China where it was called "shoushiling", which means hand command games.It was then subsequently imported into Japan, where it reached its modern standardized form.</p></li>
            <li><p>Rock,Paper,Scissor is chanted while playing the game, followed by an exclamation of "shoot" at the moment when the players are to reveal their choice(i.e. "Rock,Paper,Scissors,Shoot!").</p></li>
